--</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Dreams" tags="" position="1397,1" size="100,100">dreams:[&quot;You dream that you are desperately looking for someone or something. You hear what sounds like a distant whisper or weeping that you cannot locate. Eventually you fall to your knees exhausted and you hear the voice more clearly. Putting you ear to the ground you realise the weeping is coming from the earth beneath you. &quot;,&quot;You dream that you are lying prone in the dark. There is no light and no noise. You try to move but something prevents you from moving. Even breathing becomes difficult as an enormous weight presses you down. You open your mouth to cry out and it fills with soil and earth. &quot;,&quot;You lie in the dark listening to your heartbeat. Slow and regular. It is very peaceful just listening to the regular beat. Then the beat quickens - getting louder despite you not moving. Louder it gets and the beat is no longer coming from you but from the darkness all around you. And you realise your own heartbeat is still and silent.&quot;,&quot;You are walking through a dark rocky place. You can see only the vaguest of forms and often stumble over rocks or the uneven ground. But a woman’s voice keeps whispering in your ear leading you on. Slowly the whisper gets louder and you start to walk more confidently. The ground is smoother and sloping down. You are almost running when the ground falls away beneath you and you fall without end… &quot;, &quot;You dream that you are in a barren empty land. You are waiting for someone.The sun sinks towards the horizon and the shadows lengthen. It is getting cold and you are hungry. Still you wait. In the distance wolves howl and as darkness descends you hear something else snuffling and growling nearby. It is not the cry of any animal but something else. And suddenly you know you are abandoned and the one you wait for is not coming. There is the sound of weeping nearby. Then your realise: it is you who weep. &quot;, &quot;You dream that you desperately scrabbling at the ground - trying to reach the sounds of someone weeping beneath. You cut hopelessly at the earth with your axe but to no avail. The weeping is getting more and more desperate as if gasping for air. You realise you cannot save them by your efforts. You draw your knife and run the blade across your wrists. The blood pours out into the earth. And as your consciousness fades away you the see the blood dissolving away the earth and a woman’s arm reaching out towards you as your life’s blood flows away. &quot;, &quot;You dream of Ethwyn and see her far off lying alone in an arid and barren land. You hear the sound of a woman weeping. You try to reach her but something keeps leading you away. Thorn bushes you cannot penetrate. Quicksand that must be avoided. The sun sets and you struggle on in the dark, no longer able to see her - led only by the weeping woman. But it proves too much and you collapse exhausted as hyenas laugh nearby. Then you look up and see Ethwaine standing over you. You abandoned my daughter like all men do. There is only one way you may reach her now. She reaches out and you see she holds a knife out. You take it and pace the point to your heart as the laughter of the hyenas gets louder. &quot;, &quot;You dreams are torturous and throughout them all you here a woman&#39;s voicing whispering to you - calling out to you for help. BUt you cannot find her anywhere until you realise she speaks from the earth beneath your feet. How many more times will you dream this?&quot;]

No need to explain the failure of the hero quest.

You nod agreement and see the relief on the old warrior&#39;s features.

You know he speaks the truth.

The only hope of saving the women and children is to flee immediately but they will still need your protection to reach safety. the old warrior and his brothers can perform a last service to their kin and provide cover for your escape.   

You speak your blessings and farewells to the old warriors as they prepare to make their final stand. 

You gather the women and children, and lead them out into the night. You and your followers slay a watching Telmori scout and then flee south towards Culbrea lands. You glance back at the burning stead and see the little group of warriors taking their fight to the wolves in a final act of defiance. It will be over soon.

But will it? You see doubt in Karyth&#39;s face. 

The grizzled warrior shakes his head. 

&quot;Even with three great warriors such as you, we are too few and our foes too strong. They fight as if possessed and their magic is strong. I fear they have already defeated us - it is but time. 

Would you not wish your family be led to safety if it could be done?

The following day in a Culbrea chieftain’s hall - you meet the same thane who sent you to help Treetop stead against the telmori. The warriors who clearly serve and obey him, appear more richly dressed than he does.  

He greets you with kindness and requests you recount what has taken place - listening without interrupting.

It is not long before the Telmori attack again. Fire is set to the remaining houses and there are not enough of you to extinguish the flames and hold off the enemy. 

The old warrior and his brothers are cut down rescuing others from the burning buildings.

Soon you are forced to flee - trying desperately to rally what survivors you can, but the battle claims many lives.

&quot;I will never flee before chaos old man. Join us if you will not flee and help take the fight to the wolves. We may not live to tell the tale, but  your women and children will escape.&quot;

You see the doubt in the old man&#39;s eyes but he and his brothers argue no more and gather the women and children to tell them of your plan. 

You charge out to face the wolves, hoping to distract them as those fleeing vanish into the night towards Culbrea lands. At first success - you cut down a few rash Telmori warriors who underestimate your wrath and your skill. But they soon learn.

Soon you wish you had the Bull&#39;s magic against chaos foes who elude your weapons as they skirmish with you

Amongst the woods they know so well.
In the dark they can through.
On a night, their leader has conquered death.
In a season when you have no magic.

The old warrior falls first - a javelin through the chest as he is unable to keep up with the rush of your shield-wall.

Soon you find yourself sheltering amongst the thorn bushes and a gnarled yew - fending off attacks. Chysman takes an arrow through the thigh and you wish Carrick was with you. 

But dawn is at hand - not long to resist.

And you do resist, for your foes seem little interested in pushing their advantage.

The sun rises, the Telmori leave you and vanish in the mist as you slowly, so slowly, begin the march back to Culbrea lands to seek safety for yourselves.

And an hour later you stumble across the remains. Not one from Treetop stead escaped. While you were trapped in the woods, they were torn apart by wolves.

There is nothing to rescue.

In any case you have doubtless heard of some of my less glorious deeds - fleeing the battlefield upon which my tribal King and Queen Kallyr still fought. So can now each look upon the other as an equal - for we have both failed those we wished to serve.

So what does Cuthbert Coriales, once of Prax, now drifter across Sartar, wish from a King renowned only for his cowardice?&quot;

A silence falls over the hall - and you feel as if others have a better sense of what hangs in the balance of this meeting than you do.  Despite the King’s reputation as doing only what the Empire asks of him you can see no obvious sign of Lunar influence among his followers.

So you are not without duties of your own. You may not be a king but you are the brother of a chieftain, a husband, and thane of a clan who seeks leadership and sanctuary. 

You wish to find them a place of sanctuary? It is normal. 

You are married to Ethwynn and have fought alongside Joshua Peacetalker, one of our most renowned prophets and priests, if no ardent supporter of my kingship (various chuckles and some silences around the court).

Your clan of course is not one of our own...

You question the King: You say that you are a coward. You also have a reputation for being supportive of the lunars. Yet I ask myself is this cowardice a mask to keep your tribe safe ?

The words prompt a glimpse of a smile from Ranulf.

You continue: As a coward king you would be no threat. Which would allow you to have meetings with drifters or those the Lunars might not welcome. You ask what does Cuthbert Coriales, once of Prax now drifter across Sartar, wish from a King renowned only for his cowardice? Where truly lies your loyalty?

There is a long silence in the hall before Ranulf responds:

As a worshipper of the Plough God I continually remind my thanes that even warriors need feeding. There are many ways to fight our foes - sometimes with the sword at other times by different means. 

The Culbrea did not choose their path any more than you chose to be homeless and wandering through Sartar in the worst winter in living memory. We all bear the consequences of our own decisions... and our failings... and what we have learnt from them time will reveal.

However, although he stayed a while in your clan lands he never announced himself as the Colymar are now ruled by a King in open allegiance with the Lunars and rumoured to have left Orlanthi ways. 

With the loss of the winds and the start of winter he sought refuge with the Culbrea - knowing that here too there were ties. News of the clans defeat came shortly after - and the King persuaded Calops to remain at least until the winter eased and travel would be easier. 

He is apologetic at tarrying so long but relieved to know that many of the clan survived. He clearly has respect for Ranulf.

You are right to ask about conditions and I take no offense. 

Fear not, I am not a merchant anymore than a warrior -  I do not trick anyone who claims kinship to the Culbrea in good times or in bad. 

For your clansmen, I extend hospitality to them for one year in return for their loyalty and what help they can offer. There is much work to till our soils, prepare our harvests and protect our herds. But also we have no shortage of foes for you to fight if that is your wish. I can offer you refuge and welcome - but I cannot offer you peace. If you wish to designate a steward, it is your right. I do not seek to imprison you within my lands and I see you seek after a greatness of your own. 

We will find you lands to call your own - assuming that one day this winter breaks and spring returns - otherwise none of us will have need for lands. Should those lands not meet your expectations, by the end of the year you and your people will be free to leave with our blessings. I hope you will join us - for I sense many seasons and years of great turmoil - a time when we do better to forge new bonds for those without kin or home will be the first to suffer. 

My tribe has lost rich and fertile land to our rivals these past years - some of our clans deserted us others were forced from us. Those who were driven from us, I will one day welcome back to the fold. Those who abandoned us I will offer clemency to, but my patience has its limits. It may well be that from those who abandoned us, we will take back our lands and give to those who have stood by us - why not to the Coriales? 

Now is the time now is to gather the seeds and prepare them for sowing once spring returns. Then we can speak of what harvests we reap and how best to distribute the fruit of our labour. To those who show loyalty I am not ungenerous. If I wished to sell you I would have done so and been already richly awarded...

Of course you are worried for your companions.

Yet they and the  banner they follow is not here, and you are not the bearer of the banner. They have passed now beyond your care.

Rest assured that should you companions return this way, I will not judge them severely for their failure. They tried - that is enough for me. I will offer hospitality and advise them the best I can should they wish it.

And after, if the call of the banner is too strong then seek after it. But would you not do so with a lighter heart if you knew your family and clan had found some safety?

Ah Cuthbert - were I a thane without master I would easily be swayed by such words. But I am not. 

I remain a simple farmer at heart. I believe in preparing the ground, tilling the soil, sowing the seeds. In my experience a good crop requires patience and cannot be hastened… Only when we sow crops that can survive a harsh winter or a drought-ridden summer, only after much toil and few words do we expect a harvest. While always fearful that an unknown blight will turn all our work to nothing. For us farmers, words seem easy and any fool can die trying to restore their wounded pride… and many have.  I admire their bravery but lament their loss.

No - a King cannot swear to a unknown banner or a fleeting hope. Chasing after prophecies I leave to the god-talkers and others wiser than I am. If I am to regain my honour and bring glory to this Tribe then I will do so as a farmer does - by careful preparation, knowledge of the land and long hours toiling in the field.

You travel that day to Orlmarl&#39;s stead - that lies in the foothills of Two Pine Ridge.

The long-hall is richly carved and decorated. Within it are displayed many trophies and prizes taken across generations of the family. It is clearly either a very wealthy family or perhaps a very violent family that has acquired such trophies through conquest and raiding. 

There you rest a couple of days - while your new companions busy themselves with preparations for your journey.

During that time you have the opportunity to learn more about your new companions or the journey ahead:

They listen to you as you recount the death of Joshua and many other tales from when you knew him.

They are saddened but also grateful for your news - clearly holding him in great repute.

You leave just before dawn on a cold frosty morning. 

Mounted and with a couple of mules to carry additional supplies, you make good progress despite the freezing weather and lack of roads. It is clear that your companions know this land very well.

Just before sunset you reach a long and wide valley beyond which, illuminated by the setting sun you see the wide open grasslands of Prax.

Malan and the Humakti go ahead with one of the mules to parley with the trolls while the rest of you make camp in an old ruined watch tower that overlooks the valley. 

You notice signs that the tower has been recently camped in.

Soon after sunset you begin to hear snuffling and other noises of movement close to the tower.

Do you:

&quot;Many fleeing the Red Moon come here for refuge. For The lunars are too fearful to cross either Telmori lands or the lands of the Uz - unless they come with a legion of troops for their protection.

Many of those close to Kallyr have found refuge in these lands so I am not surprised to find signs of recent travelers in these parts.

You talk a bit more about Kallyr and the resistance, forgetting the noises outside, until Malan and his companions return just before [[dawn. -&gt;dawn]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="dawn" tags="" position="1790,2853" size="100,100">doy: doy+1

Malan returns with news that the Sazdorf clan will allow you all to pass through battle Valley unmolested, as long as you are long gone by next sunset.

As you hasten to break camp and lead your horses through the valley, Malan adds that the Uz were not happy that Humakt had been bested by the Wolf and that the Shaman Broken Fang had been greatly strengthened by the failed heroquest. 

But for the time being that is not your concern. For now we must travel north to the Pavis trade road and from there we should be in Pavis within a few days.

&#39;Unless we decide that our paths might wander a little from that road,&#39; says Orlmarl.

Malan frowns but you have not time to query him or Orlmarl further. 

You ride out of the valley and [[across the grasslands of Prax-&gt;tothepavisroad]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="tothepavisroad" tags="" position="1225,725" size="100,100">doy: doy+1

You make good progress over the next couple of days - as you ride over the grasslands of Prax to the trade road.

Your companions are in good spirits and even Karyth and Chysman appear to relax - perhaps its was few days rest at Orlmarl&#39;s stead?

You pass one long trading caravan led by Etyries merchants and well protected by worshippers of the Red Moon and Northern Sartarites.

&quot;You&#39;re going the right way!&quot; they laugh, &quot;at least the grass still grows out east.&quot;

Malan exchanges friendly words but the rest of you pass them silently.

# Chapter {chapter}: Across Prax

Orlmarl comes to speak to you that evening.

My friend and fellow Orlanthi. It is not long now until One Day is upon us. I desire to worship Orlanth on this day. There is the great holy place of Pairing Stone only a few days travel from here. My father often worshipped there and so did you.

Will you not join with me and my followers and travel together to join with other allies of the wind to make sacrifice?

It would not delay us long and you may find friends who could help us on our mission.

I know also that you once worshipped with the Uroxi. Three days hence it is his holy day and then five days later One Day. If we leave now we may offer worship to both the gods. We would be gone little more than a week.

 &quot;I fear Orlanth no longer hears our sacrifice, but if you wish once again to commit yourself to the Storm Bull it is a chance so to do.&quot; He smiles.

Skanthos says that he is here to to attend to his King&#39;s wishes to bring the Lady Ethwayn and her daughter back to Culbrea lands where they belong. He is ready to help protect the remains of your clan as well as they are guests of his king. As for Orlanth - he has left his feasting hall - if there is a king who rules now it is Humakt until Orlanth returns. 
&#39;I for one will not travel to Pairing Stone, but if it is your wish I will wait on your return - at least for a week&#39;.

Malan listens and then observes it is not for him to tell worshippers of Orlanth or the Bull whether to make sacrifice to their gods. But his duty here is to  assist you and your clan return to Sartar. Like Skanthos he is ready to wait in Pavis for your return but warns that a trip to Pairing Stone is not without risks. 
&#39;Many of your foes will see One Day as their chance to inflict further injury on the worshippers of the Wind Gods. Are you sure your gods will receive your sacrifices?&#39;

Orlmarl frowns and observes that when did Orlanthi ever fear their foes or turn away from a fight if it was in service of their gods. He looks to you expectantly.

&quot;Look for me at Gimpy&#39;s in about ten days time&quot; he tells you.

You watch in silence as they ride north. Karyth is clearly unhappy while Chysman hides his emotions. 

Calops nods.

&quot;It was the right decision - now is not the time to go chasing after false hopes. Others have need of you now.&quot;

The following morning, Orlmarl and his followers are in good spirits as all six of you set off for Pairing Stone. You remember your own trip there and how it almost cost the life of your brother Gerrin at the hands of trollkin.

As you prepare your horses and mules, Orlmarl explains that he has travelled to Pairing Stone several times and will lead you by paths that few others know.

You want to intervene but you cannot, your limbs are shackled by heavy chains that bind you to others. Angrily you pull at the shackles, dragging those who are chained to you through the dust.

You glance back at Gerrin and see it is not a trench, but a grave he is digging - the grave of Orlanth.

Keeping to the valleys is the only option - the steep and rocky slopes offering good ambush but no route for your mounts. In the distance you see heavy snow lying on the hill just to the north.

A few hours after midday you come across signs of conflict just where a narrow gorge joins the valley you are following. Shattered arrow shafts litter the ground as do multiple tracks of herd beasts and others. The decapitated body of a Scorpionman lies near the entrance to the gorge, where many tracks are also seen.

Orlmarl gestures that you should follow the main valley towards Pairing Stones.

You leave the gorge and travel on along the valley towards the Pairing Stones while light lasts. Everyone seems weary from the travel and the cold feels more intense than recent days.

You set camp in a sheltered spot and soon most of you are asleep. Taking the first watch, you hear some distant songs then cries and bellows carried on the night air. Then silence. 

You turn in when your watch is up but a shadow intrudes into your dreams and you sleep fitfully...

And awake beneath a blanket of snow.

&#39;Very well,&#39; acquiesces Orlmarl. &#39;Lead on - it is better we stay together with chaos about.&#39;

You lead the way, following the tracks. Soon you have to dismount and lead your mounts on foot among the boulders that litter the canyon floor as it turns north and becomes increasingly narrow.

After an hour&#39;s slow travel, you begin to wonder if you will have to abandon the pursuit. The next moment you stumble upon a small campsite among the boulders. There is a moment of confusion as each group draws weapons while controlling mounts and shouting warnings.

They are Uroxi - nomads mostly although they include two horse-riders that surprises you. After a moments of mutual distrust, they explain they are hunting Scorpionman raiders that have long been attacking pilgrims to the Pairing Stone and have grown bolder in the long winter. 

The Uroxi explain they have them trapped in the gorge and their task now is to keep them there until the arrival of their Jarl on the coming Holy Day.

&#39;Typical of Orlanthi to appear when the hard work is done&#39; observes one of the horse riders,&#39;But you are welcome to camp with us - unless of course being close to chaos makes you nervous?&#39;

Do you:

Tell him that you&#39;ve better things to do than baby-sit Uroxi and, while there is still light, [[head back out of the gorge-&gt;pstone.night2]]

Orlmarl is soon busy talking with the horse-riders of events in Prax. The beast-riders are less friendly keeping to themselves until one comes over and asks if you have drink to share.

One of the Uroxi spends the rest of the night clutching his head, occasionally hitting it against a nearby rock. Others are also clearly in pain or discomfort.

Orlmarl appears uneasy as the banter turns more aggressive. 

One of the nomads shares fermented lama milk but even some of the Uroxi hesitate to partake. A couple of them seem to be determined to drink anything that will numb their feelings. You notice others clutch at old wounds as if they were raw.  You wonder if nearby chaos is the cause.

Karyth has the final wine skin grabbed from him by one of the nomads. He rises quickly and growls that no-one takes what is his without asking. The nomad pushes him away, gulping down the wine.

Do you:

You do however learn from one who lived at Bullford before joining Urox, that the long winter is particularly hard for the Sartarite communities along the river of Cradles as crops fail and stores run dry.

A tiny settlement lies beneath the Stones. A few buildings, all one story tall and built of the same pale brown stone cluster around the now empty market just to the south of the stones. Nearby are pitched a dozen or so nomad tents of varying durability.  

A much tattooed man in his early fifties, with four followers greets you.  

Farangar Horseteeth, Wind Priest of the Bullford clan and guardian of the Stones extends hospitality to all pilgrims to the stones.

You sense he recognizes your name but says no more than to observe that it is your first time here. 

Firstly, Farangar advises, gesturing to the nomad tents, you should present your self to our Uroxi guests as well. Jarl Ivangar is a friend of mine and once he has completed sacrifices to the bull in these coming days he will remain with us until One Day.

On that day we will join the Uroxi - for it is right that we all offer sacrifice to the Storm Bull in this time. Urox will prove his strength by defeating his chaos foe and in return the Bullford clan and I will invite  the Jarl and his men to stay at Pairing Stone until One Day. They will be welcome in helping us defeat any foes on that day.
I know Ivangar well and he is well-known to the Bullford clan so he and his men often join our worship. The other Jarl is no friend of ours, but as he was bested by Ivangar he is obliged to obey his lead while at the stones.

You are woken just before dawn by the return of the uroxi. Soon the whole of Pairing Stone is awake and gather at the stones as a cold sun rises and light glistens off the frosty ground.

The uroxi are gathered at the centre of the stones where they have also shackled a captive of their hunt: a scorpionman. The hideous creature looks half dead or drugged, covered in tattoos that suggest it was a worshipper, or perhaps shaman,of Bagog it looks more piteous now than deadly foe.

Several of the warriors can hardly stand from the pain of wounds or being in the presence of chaos. Healers quickly calm those that cannot retain their fury in its presence.

## Wildday: Bellow Day
Khan Ivangar approaches you.
&#39;You have proved yourself able to face Chaos and my styrdman Actos speaks highly of you.
[if sbull&gt;50]
&#39;I sense that Storm Bull calls you. Do you wish to answer that call?&#39;

How do you reply?

&gt; [[I wish to follow the call of Urox, but I must also lead family and clan to safe haven-&gt;pstone.accept]].
 
&gt; [[I follow Orlanth now, even if he is silent, and have family and clan to bring to safety -&gt;pstone.refusal]].

[else]
Yet I sense that your heart does not truly seek after Urox. There is no shame in that, but the call of Urox is all demanding. I thank you for joining us on the hunt but now it is time you [[return to your Orlanthi brothers. -&gt;pstone.watching]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="126" name="pstone.wildwindday4" tags="pstone" position="8648,3268" size="100,100">It is already dusk when you approach the end of the gorge, high cliffs indicating little hope of escape for anything trapped here. The uroxi seem little concerned by the thought of having to battle chaos in the nighttime.
Ivangar calls a brief halt to prepare his men for the fight ahead.He reminds them again of their duty to capture one of their foes and also of the caves in the cliff walls in which the Scorpionmen may have taken refuge. 
He and the most experienced warriors take the lead towards the cliffs, while the less experienced and those who feel unable to control their killing rage remain among the rocks in the gorge floor.

Will you:

&gt; [[Join the experienced warriors-&gt;pstone.wildwindday5]] 

&gt; [[Remain with the less experienced and balanced warriors-&gt;pstone.wildwindday8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="127" name="pstone.wildwindday5" tags="pstone" position="8858,3404" size="100,100">You join with the two Jarls, Actos and eight other experienced warriors as they pick their way towards the cliffs.
Ivangar and his men appear familiar with the terrain and soon you are faced with three cave entrances vanishing into the cliff face. 
Within, explains Actos the caves join into a single underground vault without other escape. We call it [[slaughter cavern-&gt;pstone.caves]] he grins.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="128" name="pstone.wildwindday8" tags="pstone" position="9019,3278" size="100,100">The experienced warriors soon vanish into the growing darkness and for what seems ages there is no sign of conflict. Several of those with you gnaw the edges of their shield or cut new tattoos into their skin to pass the time and distract themselves from their sense of nearby chaos.
Then, the clear sounds of fighting ring out across the gorge. Several of the uroxi can no longer control themselves and charge towards the sounds of fighting while others restrain themselves. 
Will you [[chase after those who have charged ahead-&gt;pstone.wildwindday9]] or [[remain with those still with you-&gt;pstone.wildwindday10]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="129" name="pstone.wildwindday9" tags="pstone" position="9032,3718" size="100,100">You chase after the uroxi, soon out of sight of those that remained. The enraged warriors run straight into an escaping scorpionman and are soon exercising their rage on its bloody slaughter.
You realise there is little to do here and a risk that they turn on you, so quickly head back to the inexperienced warriors that remained behind and from where you here sounds of further fighting as you approach.
You return in time to see them overcoming two more chaos foes but one of their number has been slain and several injured.
You are still ruing the decision to leave them when Jarl Ivangar and his men return from the hunt a little after midnight, dragging with them a [[captive foe-&gt;pstone.captive]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="130" name="pstone.wildwindday10" tags="pstone" position="9182,3718" size="100,100">You remain, encouraging the inexperienced warrior to obey their Jarl&#39;s command. Suddenly out of the gloom, two Scorpionmen emerge, hurling javelins and trying to break through your ranks.
With  the remaining uroxi, you and your followers repel the attack and soon the chaos foes lie slain at your feet.
The sounds of fighting gradually grow quiet and a little after midnight Jarl Ivangar and his men return dragging behind them a [[captive foe-&gt;pstone.captive]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="131" name="pstone.captive" tags="pstone" position="9094,4171" size="100,100">The scorpionman  is covered in blood and dust, but you can make out that his skin is covered with tattoos with teeth and stones sowed crudely into his flesh at many places. No sound comes from it and the eyes appear dull and lifeless.

A rope is lashed round the stinger and the near lifeless captive dragged [[down the gorge by his warriors-&gt;pstone.captive2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="132" name="pstone.caves" tags="pstone" position="8837,3556" size="100,100">Each of the Jarls take three men and select an entrance, leaving Actos, another young Uroxi, Borax, yourself and your followers to take the final cave.
&#39;Kill everything you meet until you reach slaughter cavern. After that just stay out of the way&#39;, advises Ivangar.
Lighting torches you divide into your groups and approach the cave opening. As they approach, the uroxi begin bashing swords on shields and singing songs. Flushing out the prey, you suppose. 
Actos and Borax lead the way into [[the darkness below-&gt;pstone.caves2]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="133" name="pstone.caves2" tags="pstone" position="8837,3706" size="100,100">Something large moves in the darkness, sending stones rattling as it flees the approach of your light.

Above you, the light of the torches reveals a narrow fissure. And within that the scorpionman just before it drops.

A keen axe blow severs the head as it lands among you.

You continue on, and soon hear the sound of more intense fighting and fury as you enter [[slaughter cavern-&gt;pstone.slaughtercave]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="136" name="pstone.captive2" tags="pstone" position="8888,4370" size="100,100">When you reach the head of the gorge you mount up without any pause or rest.

The sound of fighting ahead hides the sound of its descent.

Only Karyth turns. Just in time to throw up a shield and deflect the stinger from his face. The sword of sartar cuts the tail in two and Chysman quickly dispatches the wounded creature.

Karyth glares at you muttering that we needn&#39;t behave like Uroxi even if we choose to accompany them. 

The sound of conflict prevents any further discussion as you hasten after Actos and enter [[slaughter cavern-&gt;pstone.slaughtercave]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="138" name="pstone.slaughtercave" tags="pstone" position="8924,4117" size="100,100">The cavern is full of shadows and smoke. And the stench of chaos and hazia.

Trapped between the three groups of uroxi, eight Scorpionmen try to resit the inevitable, hampered by the close quarters and lack of space.

Behind them, crouched over a guttering smokey fire, another scorpionman intones in a some strange tongue a Bagogi ritual, its eyes rolled back with hazia. 

The uroxi begin the slaughter as the intonation becomes more desperate.
You hack down a wounded Bagogi who manages to break past Actos and Borax. Beyond, in the smoke of the fire you see something forming - the glimpse of a female face crowned with jewels, behind it two scorpion tails rising.

&#39;Aaaiii Gagix, Bagogi rez...&#39; intones the voice. And  the eyes roll back and you glimpse a red light within.

And then Ivangar scatters the fire and buries a fist into the face of the scorpionman, silencing it and the ritual in one blow.

The rest is soon over.

Corpses are piled up, a few wounds tended.

You return from the caves, dragging the captive Bagogi with you and are reunited with those who waited outside.

In the moonlight you examine the captive more carefully as the uroxi prepare to [[depart-&gt;pstone.captive]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="139" name="pstone.accept" tags="pstone" position="6645,4122" size="100,100">sbull: sbull+10

Go, awaken your family if that is your desire. It is from them that you will draw strength for the fight to come. For we are all weakened when the earth sleeps.&#39; 
He pauses, staring beyond you for a moment.

Actos shakes his head in disappointment. The Jarl gives you a long look.

&#39;And after? When family and clan are safe do you think you will rest peacefully? I doubt it Cuthbert Coriales, for peace is not in your nature, but I wish you well.

But if you cannot rest and seek a god who still rages in the darkness, when others are silent, seek for us at the Block next Stasis week of Fire Season when all who wish to follow Urox will muster to their Jarls. And we will see if Urox remembers you.

You remain within the stones, joining Actos the other Uroxi as they dedicate themselves to drinking fermented llama milk and bad beer as an offering to the Storm Bull. A few gather around the fire lighting hazia pipes - perhaps to sooth the pain they feel from the close presence of chaos. 
Brawls erupt between Uroxi but are soon over. Karyth looks unimpressed but Chysman seems happy enough.
Herd spirits and others start moving among the worshippers, or perhaps that is just the drink? You feel the pain or a myriad of wounds return. The sun grow dim even though it must be close to [[midday-&gt;pstone.invite]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="142" name="pstone.watching" tags="pstone" position="7126,4281" size="100,100">You stand just outside of the stones, with Orlmarl and your followers, watching the Uroxi rituals. 

The Uroxi are  focussed on drinking and eating - vast amounts of fermented llama milk, Sartar beer and the cheapest Holy country wine are all consumed with abandon - an offering to the Storm Bull. 

You recall the drunken rituals and brawls at the shrine in Pavis. In seems many lives ago. 

Other Uroxi cluster around the fire and smell the scent of hazia pipes being passed around and shared. Occasionally a fight breaks out but it passes quickly. 
Shackled to the stones, the scorpionman is slumped, unmoving. Two  Uroxi stand guard over it - preventing any of their brothers from seeking to finish off the &#39;sacrifice&#39; before it&#39;s time.
As the hours pass, the mood of the crowd begins to turn from amusement to [[impatience.-&gt;pstone.invite]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="143" name="pstone.twisters" tags="pstone" position="6936,4506" size="100,100">The air grows heavy and  the sky darkens.

To the west the sun has turned blood red - hidden by a wall of dust and sand thrown up by the approaching whirlwinds. Yet still no wind. Your followers shift uneasily and check their weapons.

You see the scorpionman&#39;s eyes flicker open. Bright yellow pupils stare out, as it shifts its posture to watch the twisters approach.

THe whirlwinds converge as they approach the stones - the Uroxi casting magic and making offerings to Urox in preparation. 

And then the desert storms arrive and all is sound and fury... and [[chaos-&gt;pstone.eternalbattle]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="144" name="pstone.invite" tags="pstone" position="6938,4332" size="100,100">The Stormvoice Farangar steps forward and sacrifices a black ram to Urox on behalf of all the pilgrims of the stones.

A few of those outside the stones leap to join the Uroxi in their eternal battle, despite the shouted commands of Farangar that this it is for Urox to prove his strength.

You watch the fury and struggle that lies within the whirlwind and the quiet calm without. Some Uroxi are cast out of the storm to the ground below. Occasionally chaos falls from the whirlwind and are pinned to the ground by stones falling like rain or hacked down by the gathered witnesses to the ritual.

A part of you wishes to join the Uroxi in their ceaseless battle, but another part remembers family and clan that depend on you.

To the startled cries of your followers, you abandon the other watching pilgrims and leap between the stones, drawn up into the raging battle. There you meet once more the old foe - the chaos that incessantly gnaws away at your being. And once again you better it despite taking many wounds - and then you see what lurks beyond it, deeper in the void - and you realise that it exceeds the courage at your command. You realise that to best it only a mad, unbridled rage could hope to conquer - a rage that renounces all other loyalties and passions.

You are hurled from the raging storm and thrown onto the stony ground among the stones where your followers summon the attention of [[healers-&gt;pstone.watch1]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="147" name="pstone.watch1" tags="pstone" position="6848,4835" size="100,100">Soon the ground around the stones is littered with exhausted Uroxi - victors of their individual battles who can only watch those who still fight within the raging whirlwind. Only Ivangar remains fighting. His foe the once unmoving sacrifice is now transformed into a two-tailed Bagogi demon - drawing new life it would seem from the whirlwind. Each of Storm Bull&#39;s ancient allies are called upon to give new strength to the Uroxi Jarl. Fire and Ice give aid, as do Light and Dark, lending him strength to keep fighting. 

Finally he is flung from the spinning vortex like so many of his followers  to lie it seems exhausted on the earth and he calls on the last ally of Urox to lend him her power.

Across her brows a golden light flickers as if a crown. 
As the Jarl is lifted towards the creature, he seems to find new strength and struggles, slowly freeing himself from the impaling barb.
Too late.
The demon bites open the back of his head and feeds on what is within.

## Godsday
Several small groups of pilgrims arrive at the stones, but there is a sense of unease and many arguments break out among the gathered Orlanthi during the day with Farengar frequently having to intercede to calm things down.

Safety in numbers observes Karyth, although you suspect few of those arriving today would fare well in any fight. 

At midday, a long debate breaks out among the pilgrims. Several see the defeat and banishment of the uroxi as an ill omen and say there are not enough to withstand any foes that might attack. Others grumble of the cold and fear nomad raids. Others wonder if Orlanth is dead and there is no point offerig sacrifices.
Orlmarl says he has come from far Sartar to sacrifice here and mocks those who complain and have travelled less. Farangar warns Orlanth will remember those who abandon him in the time of darkness.

Do you:

&gt; [[Listen but remain silent.-&gt;pstone.silent1]]

&gt; [[Speak out in favour of remaining until One Day.-&gt;pstone.stay1]]

&gt; [[Argue that everyone should leave the stones together.-&gt;pstone.leave1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="161" name="pstone.silent1" tags="pstone" position="6793,6088" size="100,100">The arguments get more heated, with several nomads turning on Orlmarl asking if the wind blows any stronger in Sartar than on the plains. Only in the wastes does the Desert wind blow, they claim, because the tribes remain unconquered by the moon.
Many of the nomads leave later than afternoon, watched moodily by the remaining pilgrims.

You speak out in support of Farangar and Orlmarl, recounting to everyone that in the darkness, those who did not remain united and remembered their gods and myths were the first to lose their way.

There are many nods of approval and the arguments cease, although you wonder for how long before the [[doubts return-&gt;pstone.godsnight]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="163" name="pstone.leave1" tags="pstone" position="6634,6048" size="100,100">orlanth: orlanth - 5

You cannot bear their blindness any longer. Orlanth is dead you announce. And so will we all be if we remain here until One day. Better to leave the stones now - heed the defeat of Urox and return to our homes and families while we can.

Orlmarl shakes his head sadly while Farangar turns on you and says if you have not the courage to stand by your god then perhaps it is better you leave but he and his clansmen will never abandon Orlanth. 

Several pilgrims leave that afternoon, including many nomads.

The full moon shines down upon the stones, casting a faint red glow across the land.

After midnight, you wake and hear distant drums echoing out over the hills.

## Freezeday
After a poor night&#39;s sleep you awake to find that the drums of the night have provoked new questions among the pilgrims. Around midday scouts bring back news that a group of about a dozen pilgrims from Garhound were attacked by Trolls last night a few hours away from the stones. A single survivor is recovered - Harold - a young lad of about fourteen.

A group of pilgrims from Garhound have agreed to look after the boy and ensure his safe return after the rituals.

[if leave &gt; 0]
Your followers look uneasy and eventually Chysman asks if you are leaving after your words last night? 
How do you reply:

&gt; [[Yes- so break camp and prepare to leave -&gt;pstone.departure]]

&gt; [[No, we will not abandon our brothers - at least not yet. -&gt;pstone.freezenight]]

[if stay &gt; 0]
Karyth tries to talk more with the boy wanting to learn about the trolls, but he is too traumatised to say much. You and Chysman talk with Orlmarl and some of the other warriors about improving the defense of the pilgrims and dividing into groups of warriors responsible for different parts of the defense. You hope it will help but worry at how few among you can wield any [[magic-&gt;pstone.freezenight]] 

[if stay === 0 &amp;&amp; leave === 0]
Your followers look uneasy, unsure of what your intentions are. 
&#39;We only just resisted darkness last time we were at the stones when there were many more of us&#39;, Chysman reminds you, &#39;and then we had the powers of Orlanth to aid us&#39;. 

Karyth mutters something about Orlanth will awake.

Corrals are made for the animals and herd beasts that remain.
At sunset the drums start again - this time louder or so it seems.

Close by Farangar&#39;s voice is desperately trying to keep the pilgrims together around the main fires as slingshots strike from out of the dark, but Orlmarl is already racing up towards the stones with his followers.

You resist the urge to pursue the retreating trolls and instead help Orlmarl rally the remaining warriors.

Scouts are sent out to recover a few of the animals that escaped in the night, but many are not found. 

As you survey the losses of the night, Chysman speaks with you:

Filled with the berserker spirit of Zorak Zoran, or perhaps just their  bestial nature, two trolls charge towards you as the trollkin scatter.

The fight is furious and bloody. The leading troll you hamstring and spill its guts onto the cold ground. Quickly you and your followers turn to surround the remaining troll dodging its clumsy attacks and slowly begin to weaken it with  wounds that would have slain any normal creature. Too quickly...

Unseen the first troll rises, ignoring the death wounds, to expend a final crushing blow on Karyth who turns in time to throw up a shield - that shatters as do the shoulder bones beneath. Chysman  finally slays the  creature in a furious attack while you trade blows with the remaining creature. 

Additional Orlanthi, who have followed your lead, arrive in time to help slay the second troll.

The remaining troll has spent his fury among the animals, slaying many in a wild fury before being hurled to the ground by a charging bison. The Orlanthi warriors surround and finish the troll before it has time to rise again.

You retreat back to the main campfires to seek healing and [[await the dawn -&gt;pstone.returncamp]], hoping those who remain can fend off further attack.

## Windsday: One day

Dawn breaks - or rather it doesn&#39;t.

A windless blizzard andthick cloud hides Yelm&#39;s beams as slowly people stir. Coloured smokes rise from several of the fires, while horns are blown and banners raised. 

Stumbling through the deepening snow the warriors lead the way to the stones, behind them the other pilgrims follow and the remaining animals and sacrifices. A single fire is lit among the stones. 

The drums continue, muffled by the snow.

And the roars of hollri still echo around you.

And the snow eases, and then stops.

There is a moment of silence apart from the ceaseless drums.

Farengar raises a hand and announces the ritual challenge to the foes of winter.

[[And winter responds-&gt;pstone.oneday2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="194" name="pstone.departclay" tags="pstone" position="6436,8218" size="100,100">You quickly prepare to leave.

As you discuss with the family what supplies they have, Orlmarl strides over.

&#39;I swore to help you save your clan - and in return you abandon us like this?

Are you so easily swayed by the fear of others that you will not stay but one more day? I thought there was more bravery among the clan I agreed to aid.

Chysman rises angrily, but you wave him away 

What do you respond?

&gt; [[I leave for will not aid my clan by dying beside these stones-&gt;pstone.departureclay]]

&gt; [[Accept you acted in haste and agree to remain for One day-&gt;pstone.changemind]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="195" name="pstone.claylatenight" tags="pstone" position="6763,8597" size="100,100">Dream?

You are awoken some time after midnight to the bellowing of Hollri echoing through the valley. 

&#39;They&#39;re getting closer&#39;, mutters Chysman, &#39;and more numerous.&#39;

Snow is starting to fall as you decide to take the next watch and huddle around the low fire. You see Orlmarl staring out into the night the other side of the fire, as you both await the [[rising sun-&gt;pstone.oneday1]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="196" name="pstone.oneday2" tags="pstone" position="7860,8096" size="100,100">Through the mists six huge shapes approach from the north, each taller than the stones under which you stand. Hollri.

Groups of warriors gather to meet the challenge, descending the hill to put space between the fighting ground and the stones above. Ormarl and you find yourselves facing north westwards awaiting the arrival of the approaching holri.

The drums quicken their pace as the demons approach and you wonder whether  the darkness has summoned these winter demons or driven them towards you.

You hear Farengar shouting command from the stones and women and children rush out bearing burning torches to the warriors whispering instructions to hold them off until the sacrifices are complete.

&#39;They fear fire, so the priest says, shouts the boy handing you two blazing torches.

&#39;And if they don&#39;t&#39;, observes Chysman, &#39;we can use them to light our own funeral pyres&#39;.

Orlmarl gives him a dirty look as the demons [[draw closer-&gt;pstone.oneday3]]

The demons advance slowly towards the stones and the flickering ring of  torches, one slowly climbing the hill towards you.

Will you:

You command your followers to ready a charge, ignoring their questioning looks.

You and Orlmarl rally your followers to face it with a half circle of torches and steel - although the flickering lights seem palty in the gloom of this false dawn.

It climbs further, stepping over the huge boulder just below you, raising itself to tower over your small group. 

And then it stops, swaying but no longer advancing as if hypnotised by your [[small flames-&gt;pstone.oneday4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="200" name="pstone.retreathollri" tags="pstone" position="8100,8327" size="100,100">You fall back as the demon advances, gesturing for Orlmarl to do the same. 

Several of the other groups of warriors follow your example, and soon the ring of fire has drawn back till little distances you from the stones and pilgrims.  

You hear Farengar&#39;s voice echoing out commanding the warriors to hold the line and Orlmarl shouts for you to do as ordered. 

The demon looms over you but a few metres away.

And then it stops, swaying but no longer advancing as if hypnotised by your [[small flames-&gt;pstone.oneday4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="201" name="pstone.oneday4" tags="" position="7856,8471" size="100,100">You look around across the ring of torches and back towards the stones.

Two of the demons have started to move past the stones, not bothering to climb the hill and  seemingly ignoring or avoiding the fires.  The other demons waver before the ring of flickering flames, neither advancing or retreating. 

More cheers start to ring out among the pilgrims and you hear Farengar&#39;s voice and those of other Storm voices preparing the [[sacrifices-&gt;pstone.oneday5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="202" name="pstone.oneday5" tags="pstone" position="8043,8564" size="100,100">Beneath the cloud covered sky, the fire blazes up between the stones. The sacrificial bulls are led forwards as offerings to Orlanrth. 	

The demons still lurk at the edge of your flames but no longer threaten.

The drums continue - seemingly redoubling their effort as the Orlanthi intonations of sacrifice are made and Farengar slices open the artery of the bull.

And there is the sound of [[thunder-&gt;pstone.oneday6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="203" name="pstone.oneday6" tags="pstone" position="7856,8664" size="100,100">Or so it seemed.

You remember the hail crashing off your shields and helmets, but splitting the skulls of uncovered pilgrims gathered around the stones.

You remember the sacrificed bull finally hacked down by two old warriors, leaving a trail of blood and entrails.

And you remember seeing the fire between the stones splutter and be extinguished by the ceaseless hail.

And then, as the hail turns to an icy rain - you watch as one by one the torches flicker and [[go out-&gt;pstone.oneday8]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="205" name="pstone.oneday8" tags="pstone" position="7991,8914" size="100,100">The drums strike a new triumphant beat as the hollri roar their approval to the dark sky and icy rain.

As your torches fail, you see from the gloom and darkness behind the demons, the swarms of trollkin advancing up the slope. Behind them larger figures emerge from the gloom, bearing shields and mace. 

Orlmarl shouts:

&#39;Go Coriales. Cursed was the day I asked you to accompany me. Go, and I will make what amends I can and hope Mastakos does not sleep with Orlanth when I seek his aid.&#39;

What do you do:

He grimaces.

Orlmarl and his companions turn and face the advancing demon and the darkness beyond.

You remember little of what follows. 

At first the demon falls back beneath your blows, howling in pain and anger. 

But its cries merely  attract the attention of another of the horrors that tears apart the bodies of Orlmarl&#39;s followers, hurling blody fragments across the snow. 

Orlmarl and Karyth both hurl themselves at the monster in a flurry of blows that leave it bleeding in the snow.

Meanwhile, dozens of small, dark figures hurl slingshots and disruptions at you - most ricochet off your armour or shield but it only takes one lucky strike to kill. You remember Gerrin&#39;s eye.

Karyth cries out and goes down in the snow, his kneecap shatterd. 

Orlmarl, Chysman and you throw up shields around him and [[prepare for the end-&gt;pstone.fearshock]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="211" name="pstone.fearshock" tags="" position="6483,9408" size="100,100">In the darkness beyond you sense something new begin to form - magic whirls around you and your fear deepens.

Is this how it ends - slain by trollkin,  many leagues from your family?

Is this how the gods reward you?

Or is there a chance of escape?

Somewhere you here Orlmarll crying out - words of magic and incantation.

Something in the darkness shows its secret face to you and with a cry you turn and flee - wading through the deepening snow, unaware of anyone and anything except your own despair.

Your hear Chysman&#39;s voice shouting for you to stop and Orlmarls words getting ever louder.

Nothing can stop you - not until a sudden blast of cold wind and snow envelops you. 

You sense yourself lifted from the ground - a deafening thunder of hooves - and then nothing.

You stumble up to the slope to the stones.  Past those fleeing away from the ritual place.

One grabs you, screaming that Orlanth is dead and all are doomed, before Chysman hurls him away.

At the stones, the eviscerated corpse of the sacrifical bull still twitches. Beneath it, the crushed body of an old warrior moans.

Several other acolytes and elderly intiates lie unconscious or grievously wounded around the extinguished remains of the sacrificial fires.

By the foot of one of the stones, lies the gored body of Farengel.

Karyth begins to see if there any who might be helped by healing, but Chysman drags him away.

&quot;We need horses not crippled warriors or dead priests. While we tarry with the dead and dying, the darkness will be making corpses of the horses and any survivors who can still walk.&quot;

What to do?

Karyth nods in agreement and together with a cursing Chysman lifts the bull from the broken warrior. But his wounds are beyond your healing. 

The warrior looks up at you and offers a final salute before his soul heads for Orlanth&#39;s feasting hall.

A healer such as Carrick would find much here and many lives would be saved.

But you are warriors not healers. Chysman was right - there&#39;s nothing to do and the darkness is closing in.

Do you:

Karyth frowns at your words, leaving you and Chysman to search while he tries to comfort the dying warrior.

You know you shouldn&#39;t linger long, but why should darkness claim Orlanth&#39;s magics? 

Searching Farengal you find several matrices and a small sliver of very hard translucent stone in a gold surround.

The sound of drums beating louder and cries from the animal corrals makes you realise darkness is closing in . 

It is time to leave, if not already too late.

Do you:

You rush down towards then, the screams and cries grow louder. Not all is as it seemed - many of those you thought pilgrims bear mortal wounds yet still fight - undead doubtless raised by the magics of darkness and Zorak Zoran. 

Behind the desperate fighting you see trolls and trollkin beginning to break into the corrals - killing and wounding the animals.  

The pilgrims reswill not long resist the many undead, but will helping them leave time to escape?

The animals are already panicked and many have already been taken. Several Bullford clansmen gallop past you, mounted on your horses.
You quickly find  horses for all of you and mount up - trolls are already beginning to break down the corral walls but if you leave now you may yet escape. 

As you ride out of the corral, a young Orlanthi grabs at the reins. 

&quot;That&#39;s my horse!,&quot; he cries desperately, his face etched with fear.

The corral is now akin to a knacker&#39;s yard. Trolls and trollkin are busy butchering the few remaining animals while most have stampeded from the corral.

Two dark trolls emerge from the other side of a bludgeoned bison. Dark magic glimmers off their armour and mauls. 

You heft your axe weighing the odds - you could at least buy some time for others. The trolls pause and one raises its shield.

Your memory of these lands is hazy, but remember Bullford lies on the River of Crades - the closest valley settlement to Pairing Stones.

Many of those who remained at the clan worship now gods other than Orlanth.

You are welcomed in and although the hospitality is meagre, you are happy to have shelter and some warmth. In return you share news of what happened at the Stones and news from Sartar.

How you manage to flee the slaughter you cannot clearly remember. 

Perhaps it was the spider silk cloaks that helped you evade the senses of othe trolls?

Or perhaps just the distraction of the bloodletting and the sacrifice of others.

You remember glancing back towards the corrals and there seeing a futile charge of remaining pilgrims meet a bloody end among the great trolls.

You wonder if the Garhounders and young Harold were among them. You wonder if you could have made a difference.

You awake cold and hungry. Your head hurts.

Chysman drops down beside you, peering into your eyes.

&quot;He&#39;s awake and almost looking normal&quot;, he announces and is joined by Karyth.

&quot;Sorry about the punch to the jaw,&quot; he adds, &quot;but it was the only way to stop you screaming - the last thing we needed was to attract the Uz once again.&quot;

[if trail.includes(&quot;pstone.fearshock&quot;)]
They explain that you had fled, screaming, from the on-coming darkness until Orlmarl had summoned the magic of Mastakos to carry you far from the battlefield. 
&quot;I just pray Mastakos has a sense of direction and didn&#39;t carry us further into these troll-infested hills,&quot; concludes Chysman.

[if trail.includes(&quot;pstone.onedaycorral&quot;)]
They explain that you had fled from the trolls until Karyth had rode you down and dragged you onto his horse. 
Together you managed to flee on ponies and foot. Slingshots had slain one pony and the other had collapsed but a league from the stones. 

&quot;Not even time to butcher the poor beast that had helped save our skins,&quot; mutters Karyth.

[continue]
You&#39;ve been asleep for over a day while your followers have watched over you, living off a wineskin and a single rabbit they managed to ensnare. 

&quot;We didn&#39;t keep you any,&quot; adds Chymson.
 
&quot;And no sign of Orlmarl,&quot; observes Karyth. &quot;Or anyone else.&quot;

Chysman pulls you to your feet. 

&quot;And as there&#39;s nothing more to eat and the sun has risen, I suggest we head south quickly before something picks up our trail.&quot;

You muster what little pride and energy you have left and trudge after them. 

Soon you find yourself wishing for the gifts of Havius and Carrick which helped you endure cold and hunger while in Sartar.

You remember little of the next two days - just the cold, the weariness and the fear of pursuit at all times.

You miss the blessing of Havius and Carrick that protected you from not only the cold but also the hunger - you wonder where they are now.

Night is the worst - once you hear the distant screams of some other group of escaping pilgrims and the bellows of the troll hunters on your trail.

The Garhounders make no suggestion to help - and you remain awake all night without fire and without sleep - praying that Yelm&#39;s return will find you still alive.

You make good progress over the next couple of days - travelling easily over the trade road towards distant Pavis. 

You wonder if your father once took the same road when he fled Sartar.

Your companions speak little although Calops appears cheerful - at least for a tight lipped Humakti warrior. 

You overtake several heavily laden waggons of Sartarite refugees fleeing the icy cold of their homeland. You exchange greetings and some hospitality but do not travel with them despite their wishes. 

How many more refugees will pass along this road, seeking refuge?

How many will make it to Pavis and how many will fall victim to nomads or bandits?

The night of the second day it begins to snow and you wonder what it must be like further north in the hills around Pairing Stones.

You quicken your pace over the next two days, following the Pavis trade road. At night you often hear the distant noise of drums.

[if trail.includes(&#39;pstone.agree&#39;)]
The Garhounders and your followers speculate on what befell the other pilgrims but you feel little motivation to join them. 

[continue]
Your thoughts are already turning towards your family and the others you left in Prax. To Ethwyn, your children, and to Gerrin - wherever he might be.

One morning, the road slowly winds up a low ridge of barren hills, snow unmelting in the valleys. Surely it cannot be [[far now? -&gt;pstone.sightpavis]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="229" name="pstone.sightpavis" tags="pstone" position="7693,11314" size="100,100">doy: doy+1

At the top of the ridge and look down at the River of Cradles and just a few leagues further the city of Pavis!  

&quot;Never thought I&#39;d be glad to see that cesspit once again,&quot; observes Chysman cheerfully.

[if harold === true]
The Garhounders have no desire to visit Pavis and will skirt the hills before following the river beyond Pavis. 

You say your farewells - and are promised a warm welcome should your travels ever pass through [[Garhound. -&gt;pstone.finalfarewell]]

[if !pairingStone]
Malan, Skanthos and Calops have gone ahead of you and should already be warming their feet at Gimpy&#39;s.

Malan claimed it best they went ahead to scout out the formalities at the gate. You suspect he&#39;s more worried that you and your followers will be recognised at the gate and wants to avoid being seen as your companion. 

Although he did leave you with papers saying you were in his employ to help access to the city. Generous as ever these Issaries.

[continue]
You join the queue of people seeking entry by the gates. There&#39;s no shortage of Sartarite refugees among them, many of which are denied entry. You clutch your employment paper from Malan and hope they will be enought to gain enty without too many questions.

The Lunar guards seem even slower and more petty than you recall. Their sense of invulnerability even greater than usual.

&quot;From Sartar are you?&quot; asks the Decurian, chuckling. &#39;&#39;I hear it&#39;s a bit cold out there. Although if you&#39;ve come looking for the winds you need to keep on going east. Perhaps the other side of the Wastes you&#39;ll find you gods still blowing.&#39;

You see Chysman bristling with a glint in his eye as he placed a hand on his hilt. Karyth shoots you a warning glance.

&#39;You got something to say about that?&#39; asks the Lunar.

Should you [[call Chysman to order sharply-&gt;rebuke_Chysman]] before he does something rash, [[distract these Lunars-&gt;distract_Lunars]] or [[trust the lad-&gt;trust_Chysman]] and see what happens?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="239" name="Gatehouse" tags="" position="1320,214" size="100,100">You all keep your own council as complete the formalities at the gates.

&quot;My advice to you three,&quot; continues Malan, &quot;would be to keep a low profile and be cautious about asking questions about your clan.&quot; 

&quot;Nevertheless, if you know any you can trust who might help us, then seek them out.

I am negotiating the purchase of food and clothing for our return to Sartar. But it is not easy as supplies are so short and we do not even know how many will be accompanying us. 

I think we should avoid returning by the same route. It will attract to much attention and danger. I  propose a [[different plan]] but will need your help to make it work.&quot;

Malan explains how he now thinks the best route is to follow the river down south, to the other side of Sun County, and from there take a caravan across Prax, back toward Sartar.

&quot;I hear the river water are low, however, and am not sure if navigable. 

Also we will need a boat but I understand you Cuthbert, once performed great services for Zola Fel?

So perhaps it would be wise if you make enquiries at the Temple barge and see if they can provide us with a suitable vessel to take your clan south? 

I&#39;ll leave it for you to make enquiries.&quot;

&quot;There are rumours of a new Lunar land holder having been granted land near Garhound and around the New Bog - although I find it hard to believe there would be much interest in such marshland. If it is true however, it may make our task much harder than we thought. 

Also, a new governor named Halcyon var Enkorth has recently been appointed. Many known troublemakers were crucified within the first few weeks of his arrival but I have not heard news that any of your clans people were among them. 
Nevertheless, those who might have once openly challenged the authority of the Empire are now scarce indeed, particularly now Orlanth and the Earth sleeps. 

Both earth and air temple are closed when I visited and even here at Gimpy&#39;s there is no open challenge to the governor&#39;s authority.

You quickly offer to accompany him, but he shakes his head.

&quot;I will attract less attention alone. Remember I was in Sartar during the time you rose up against the Lunars so can swear innocence if accused. 

I will send word of how things fare among your clan and family, or return myself, within a week.&quot;

Are you sure it is not simply your own desires calling you?

Yet I have heard some similar tales - those who have left clan or tribe or village to seek after a lost spirit or a lost kinswoman that call to them. 
There are many spirits that haunt the plains, broken remnants of past ages. Some are harmless, some jealous of a life they have lost.

Perhaps it is the abandoned earth calling for help... or for vengeance against the husbands who abandoned her?

He confirms that the market there is booming with most slaves, particularly those fit for manual work, being brought by Etyries or other Lunar traders.

Even the morokanth are trading their slaves rather than use them as herd beasts - shows how good the prices are.

When you ask why, he looks a little cagey, eyeing you closely.

&quot;They don&#39;t take them far, from what I gather - not back to the Empire at any rate. My guess is mining up in the hills towards Sartar. 
Perhaps they&#39;ve found a seam of bronze or gold even. 
It&#39;s better not to ask too many questions in my experience. It&#39;s not just slavers passing by Pimpers Block but more mercenaries and vexilla that I&#39;m used to seeing.

You enter Humakt&#39;s temple and find it as usual busy with duelling and training warriors.

It was always a place to hire swords, but it feels and looks different. The warriors are unfamiliar and many bear strange insignia of various mercenary companies, some even bearing the runes of death and moon. 

Around the edges of the courtyard more sell swords smoke and watch the swordplay. They have bored and hungry looks. A number of them stare boldly at you and your followers, weighing you up.

A weaselly looking warrior puffs on a pipe squinting at you closely.

Karyth leans close.

&quot;A market for sell swords seems a poor place to hang out for wanted men, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Do you:

Coriales? We have met before. My name is Cathiades who once served Krogar Wolfhelm.

Many others are also in exile - or dead. 

Truthfully, I would not advise you to linger in this place. There are few now who have any loyalty to Krogar&#39;s cause and many who would be happy to receive a generous bounty.

Why are you here? You&#39;ve spent more time fighting the worshippers of Yelmalio than conversing with them. You remember with annoyance having to leave the fight with the Templar Allalia Eskalos during the murder of the moon-loving star seer in Sun County.

Then you here a voice echoing out.

&quot;Coriales? Cuthbert Coriales?&quot;

You turn to see a Sun Dome templar, his gold breastplate shining, pacing across the hall towards you.

It was Haloric who employed your family and Xalentor to bust the hazia farm near Chomoro - eight years ago in 1614 - and who helped you purge Rabbit Hat Farm of chaos.

The last time you recall seeing him was at the inauguration of Carrick&#39;s shrine at Stormhaven. 

You were always worried he might have been among the templars you slew during the raid on Harpoon to save the Cradle.

&quot;So, you finally come to join the Lord of light?&quot; He asks jovially.

&quot;I mean, I&#39;ve all respect for Lord Invictus and [[Lady Vega-&gt;Vega]], but Belvani just has such original thoughts on everything!&quot; 

Anyway, although Pavis is hardly joyful in this long winter, Sun County also suffers terribly.&quot;

But what of you? I feared you dead or on the run. What brings you to Pavis is this dangerous winter?

You should keep to worshipping the river and you will not suffer such dreams for the earth has no power over us even if we help sustain one another.&#39;

[if passage.visits&gt;1]
&#39;If she calls to you, then you will go to protect the earth as all her husbands once have - and like all of them you will eventually abandon her.  

And then she will have her vengeance.

There is no other way - it is always the same myth.&#39;

You are ushered into the familiar rooms of Ebenara. Behind a huge desk, the &#39;solicitor&#39; looks surprised and angry at the interuption but then stops peering at you carefully.
&#39;Well, well, I must admit I did not expect, nor if I am honest hope, to see a Coriales for many seasons more.&#39; 
He looks at his scribe and gestures at you.
&#39;You never saw this man or heard his name or title - I hope that&#39;s clear?&#39;
The scribe nods, draws the shutters on the windows and leaves the two of you alone.

Ebenara lights candles then settles behind his desk. He looks a little uncomfrotable and nervous.

So, a few weeks ago, we were approached by a client to retrieve some lost property of his, about which he had received some reliable information. He wished the property to be retrieved quickly and the umm, thieves punished. In the case where retrieval was impossible, he wanted to ensure, umm the property was no longer, let us say, &#39;functioning&#39;. 

Unfortunately while we were arranging the said repatriation of his property I, umm, was reminded of what we call in the trade a [[&#39;conflict of interest&#39;-&gt;legalconflict]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="344" name="legalconflict" tags="" position="3474,129" size="100,100">He glances at you then away.

And umm, I&#39;m pleased to say that  the matter has been satisfactorily resolved. Sadly the property couldn&#39;t be returned to our original client, but he has received assurance that the said property has been buried in an appropriate umm, err [[tomb]].

You enter the halls of healing and are shocked at how crowded its courtyards are. Most of those seeking help are poor and often starving. Others show signs of having been touched by the spirits of Mallia. Even here in Pavis, the long winter is bringing with it much suffering and affliction.

After a few hours of patient waiting, you eventually manage to speak to a young initiate who looks familiar

She frowns  and then mutual recognition dawns on both of you.

Cuthbert Coriales? I&#39;m Andrea - do you not remember? I was a companion of  Carrick&#39;s for a time. 

She seems genuinely pleased and surpised at seeing you. She asks [[how she can help-&gt;Q_to_Healers]].

You impress on her the importance of seeing the Priestess and she eventually relents, guiding you through the cloisters to the elderly priestess&#39;s chambers.

Within, the sleeping form of the Antelope tribe nomad seems even more wizened and aged than you recall. She lies amid a pile of animal skins, staring blankly out the only window of the chamber. 

Andrea shakes her head.
&quot;She is rarely here now - forever she is travelling across Prax - bringing healing she says to those who call for it.&quot;

An antelope spirit suddenly manifests by you - fiery eyes staring into yours, you can sense this is no minor spirit and no spirit of healing either.

For just like all the Earth&#39;s husbands and lovers, you abandoned her - telling yourself some excuse that you do it for her, not for youself. Well now she calls you back and you cannot help but answer.

To join the rituals at the temple offers no guarantee of receiving the cultists &#39;blessings&#39; but a generous donation usually helps! Ultimately though it is the goddess and her followers who choose their couplings and those too ostentatious with their donations are often passed over in favour of one less wealthy but &#39;deserving&#39;.

It&#39;s one way to make sure the rituals are always well attended by the rich and poor alike...

Karyth nudges you as you enter.

&quot;Remember the saying, what happens in the Uleria temple remains in the [[Uleria temple-&gt;Uleria rituals]]!&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="374" name="Uleria rituals" tags="" position="2496,2559" size="100,100">Soon you are lost to the rituals of the goddess of love. 

Music and dancing seem all a part of the ceremonies and as the worhsip approaches its conclusion, the Uleria cultists begin to choose those who will be invited to participate in the goddess&#39;s &#39;secrets&#39;.

Do you:

&gt; [[Encourage your followers to receive a blessing, but keep a low profile yourself.-&gt;Uleria avoid]]

&gt; [[Enthusiastically join in the ceremonies and look to be chosen.-&gt;Uleria embrace]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="375" name="Uleria avoid" tags="" position="2377,2713" size="100,100">You remain towards the back of the gathering and see Chysman and Karyth  both led away by cult initiates. 

You decide it prudent to wait for them and settle down to watch one of the many dancers still performing. As you watch you feel yourself slowly being drawn in to the intoxicating and mesmerising movements of the woman. 

Do you:

&gt; [[Pull yourself together and leave while you still can!-&gt;Uleria leave]]

&gt; [[Keep watching the sacred rites.-&gt;Uleria dance]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="376" name="Uleria embrace" tags="" position="2541,2713" size="100,100">You join with the spirit of the rituals and are soon lost to the glamour of the occasion. 

Chysman and Karyth are both led away by cult initiates and you find yourself the centre of a dance performed by three others.

Then one of the three steps forward and leads you away to reveal the secrets of Uleria.

Do you:

&gt; [[Try to refuse - this is all a terrible mistake.-&gt;Uleria refuse]]

&gt; [[Accept it&#39;s your sacred duty to go through with this.-&gt;Uleria couple]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="377" name="Uleria refuse" tags="" position="2670,2713" size="100,100">The Uleria initiate smiles at you shaking her head.

When you think back to that night you have little recollection of what happened but the memory of how it felt never leaves you. You were blessed indeed.

A movement next to you brings you back to your senses. A young, curvaceous woman puts down her comb and smiles at you.

&quot;Well, well, well, that was an unexpected but welcome re-union Cuthbert Coriales.&quot;

For a moment your mind goes blank. She looks different from the divinity of the night, but still recognisable. 

Then all your memories rush back. The woman before you is [[Mylandera-&gt;Mylandera]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="379" name="Mylandera" tags="" position="2606,3005" size="100,100">revealed_identity: revealed_identity+3

&quot;So, fate has brought us back together again after all&quot; she smiiles.

&quot;But what else brings you to Pavis once again - for I do not fool myself in thinking it is solely to be reunited with a past love?&quot;

You think you hear your name being called, but do not pause. The image of the dance still performing in your mind. The image of the dancer strangely familiar despite the glamours of Uleria.

Your followers will have to find their own way home.

You return to Gimpy&#39;s and fall into a fevered dream. Not of the earth but of the dancer.

At dawn you awake and suddenly recall her name: [[Mylandera-&gt;Day in Pavis]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="381" name="Uleria dance" tags="" position="2432,2859" size="100,100">You keep watching and your sense of place and memories slowly fade and all that is leeft is the movement and vision of the dancer. 

&quot;You must not spurn the blessing of Uleria or she will withdraw her favours from you forever,&quot; whispers the initiate as she takes you by hand.

You feel it is an invitation of the goddess herself and [[cannot refuse her blessings any longer-&gt;Uleria couple]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="382" name="Mylandera sartar" tags="" position="2236,3049" size="100,100">She listens attentively to your story and why you have returned.

&quot;Well I must admit I never really understood why you ran off to Sartar. Especially leaving behind such a devoted wife and two sweet little children.

Something about keeping them safe wasn&#39;t it? 

I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve returned Cuthbert. I wouldn&#39;t like to think you&#39;re the kind of man to abandon family and kin when things get difficult. Like so many others I&#39;ve known.&quot;

She sighs. 

&quot;And I&#39;m glad we had a chance to catch up and share Uleria&#39;s blessings...&quot;

{back link}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="383" name="Mylandera news" tags="" position="2611,3163" size="100,100">&quot;Me? How sweet that you ask.&quot;

&quot;Well as you know, Tristram never returned from the battle of Dry Ford and you were quick to leave Blackmarsh without much of a backward glance... I stayed a while to comfort your sister and wife. I actually think your mother ended up quite liking my company once she had been abandoned by her sons and cousins. 

But news of a Lunar Grantholder arriving soon reached us. That earth witch Ethwaine cast the runes and persuaded your mother, Ethwyn and others that only the abandoned earth could offer refuge. So off they fled to the Open Wound clan.

So what is a girl to do, but return to her roots and the one place that seems to care for her.&quot;

She flashes you another sad smile. But there&#39;s also a glint of something harder in her look.

And at the same time, for a moment, you wonder if in fact it is Mylandera you have always loved? Could it be so?

Do you:

[[Declare enduring love for Mylandera-&gt;Mylandera love]]

[[Ask if she has further news of your family or the Open Wound Clan-&gt;Mylandera OWC]]

She smiles.

&quot;Of course - you must have many things to do. I hope you find your family and do send them my blessings. Your sister was very kind to me when we were at Blackmarsh.

And you know now where to find me, should you wish to share Uleria&#39;s blessings once again...&quot;

You wonder whether to tell her more, or ask her advice, but there is something you feel she is keeping hidden from you. 

&quot;Take care out there Cuthbert - not all are as generous in their blessings as the goddess.&quot;

She shakes her head and smiles.

&quot;Those worshippers of the earth have always left me a little cold and I cannot say I would wish to sleep away my life in their company. But Ethwaine spoke and what Ethwain wants, Ethwaine usually gets, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;If you think dressing up as a mercenary thug and claiming to be a sell sword fleeing chilly Sartar is enough to pass unnoticed, I beg to differ.

Maybe you think you&#39;ve been discrete these past days and by the standards of your family you may well be right. 

But a handsome, axe wielding Sartarite with a distinctive scar down his face doesn&#39;t pass unnoticed. And there&#39;s enough people who remember the antics of your family to put two and two together and get a big fat bounty!

Your old friend Lord Kyros, Ethwaine’s husband, learnt that she had left Stormhaven and sought refuge at the Open Wound clan.

&quot;Your dreams are not unlike those that have haunted Lord Kyros and even some who served him. I have heard tales from Bel Seri of nomads who have received such dreams near the land of the Open Wound and left family and tribe to follow the call. 

But I cannot tell you whether you should heed such dreams or flee them. I have heard it said that those who have abandoned wife or family are particularly susceptible to enticement. But equally, might it not be your family that calls you? 

Perhaps Cuthbert, you must simply follow your heart on this occasion.&quot;

I cannot help you Cuthbert as I have business here to deal with. Many who once walked freely about Pavis are in hiding and without Orlanth and the Earth’s magics we are all the weaker. All thought of resistance has gone - mere survival is all we can hope for at present.

&#39;I won&#39;t keep you long friend,&#39; announces the man. &#39;And I&#39;m sure you&#39;re companions would like the time to finish their drinks.&#39;

Do you:

You don&#39;t recall the name but then again you&#39;ve fought with a lot of people.

&quot;I and my companions are looking for employment and well, to be blunt, where Cuthbert Coriales goes there&#39;s usually a fight and loot to be had.

Might we join together and help one another?&quot;

You draw your axe and charge towards those approaching you from down the alley.  Somewhere behind you hear the surprised shouts of your followers - then all is the clash of blades and flowing blood.

One of the men falls back his arm almost severed from your axe, and next you sweep  off his legs with a low blow to the knee. The other two back off but with blades drawn.

Glancing back you see Karyth and Chysman exchanging brief blows with those leaving the tavern but then break free.

As all three of you charge towards them, the remaining sell swords in the alley quickly back off. 

Something thuds into Karyth&#39;s shoulder and he stumbles, cursing, only being held upright by Chysman. Behind, you hear a voice shouting. 

&quot;Cuthbert Coriales - you&#39;re going to earn me a big fat bounty either now or later you coward!&quot;

One of those leaving the tavern shouts across to you.

Two of his companions hurl throwing axes one of which grazes your head, reminding you that you&#39;re wearing only leathers. The other flashes past and you hear a grunt from Karyth somewhere behind you.

Eventually, feeling dull-headed, you remember to ask about what price or favours they expect in return for their help.

&quot;Well, Cuthbert Coriales - you&#39;re going to make me a rich man that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to do.&quot;

But they were desperate men - out of fear, hunger or greed. And their magics worked. 

An aimed blow from their captain dropped your axe and two of your fingers, while another closed in and knifed you in the chest. 

You would have gone down at that point - without rune magic or a god to call on.

# Chapter {chapter}: To the Open Wound Clan
By late afternoon you have reached the rugged hills, the river now a narrow ribbon of red towards the west. 

Your guide has not spoken a word all day but leads you without hesitation along the rocky valley before gesturing up to a low lying cliff. 

&quot;Here we will camp the night - even your clumsy steeds can be led up the terraces where we will be safe from scavengers or worse.&quot;

Soon you are camped around a low fire. Karyth points out many carvings and paintings on the walls of the cliff, while Chysman checks out some of the shallow caves. He returns saying that others have spent the night here probably many weeks ago, but could find no sign of more recent tracks. 

Bel Seri sits on a rock smoking Hazia.

And those who do know it, fear to come because of she who whispers to them in their sleep. She who calls to those who abandoned her. She who resides in these barren lands.&quot; 

He stares at you hazily.

&quot;We came here before, don’t you remember? 

We stopped here before we came to the land of ghosts and the caves of sacrifice where you spilled each other&#39;s blood for the earth.&quot;

You awake unsettled. Somewhere nearby Karyth is moaning.

Chysman gives you and Karyth an angry glance.

&quot;Or what if the person is no longer like the memory? We are always seeking after what we once had, but you cannot return to the past.&quot;

A little after noon, you begin descending down a rocky path to a wide barren valley below. To your left lies a deep canyon surrounded by cliffs and thorny scrub. 

 You have been here before.

“Nothing grows in these parts not even the poorest pasture,” explains Bel Seri.

He pulls up his sable and gestures towards the cliffs that rise about a league away, completely enclosing the valley in that direction. It would be impossible to lead horses or easily escape the valley except by the way Bel Seri has led you to.

&quot;There is your destination if you still wish to follow it. There whispering woman calls to those who betrayed her.&quot;

The clan hall is nothing but overthrown stones and a few blackened timbers. The cliff entrance to the earth temple that lay behind the Great hall is buried beneath rubble and fallen rocks - half the cliff face has collapsed burying the entrance beneath mounds of rubble. 

Several smashed skulls of various animals and herd beasts lie scattered across the ground together with signs of combat in the form of broken spears and scattering of arrow heads.

Chysman rests against a boulder looking poorly while Karyth looks around frowning. 

Do you
&gt; [[Search the ruins of the hall.-&gt;Old hall]]

You waste too many hours of light searching the place and find some signs of fighting, broken spears and arrow heads, but nothing remains of any value.

You have no time left to try to clear an entrance to the Temple caves so look to see if there is any [[path up the cliffs that surround you.-&gt;Cliff paths]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="473" name="Temple" tags="" position="3863,5380" size="100,100">You and Karyth waste the remaining hours of light heaving stones aside, hoping to find some way through.

All you uncover are some herd beast skulls and a few spent arrow heads.

But it is fruitless. The entire cliff face has collapsed and it would take a dozen men working days on end to find a way past.

There is little light left, so look to see if there is any [[path up the cliffs that surround you.-&gt;Cliff paths]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="474" name="Cliff paths" tags="" position="3564,5608" size="100,100">You peer up at the cliffs. Fortunately Karyth proves to have sharp eyesight.

He points out a low path across the cliff leading to a tangle of scrub and thorn trees, a few birds visible among them.  

&quot;That suggests there might be a water source up there - which we could well do with.&quot;

There is also a higher trail leading further up the cliff but it dissapears behind boulders. It would be a hard scramble to get up there.

Do you:

[[Take the higher path - there might be a refuge there.-&gt;Higher path]]

[[Take the lower trail and hope there is water there.-&gt;Lower path]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="475" name="Higher path" tags="" position="3572,5768" size="100,100">It is a difficult and tiring climb up the cliff - made even more difficult by the fading light.

At last you reach the boulders and fine the path leads to a cave entrance.

Within the cave you find carvings in the cliff wall of animals being led to a canyon where they are sacrificed. And warriors fighting each other in front of animal-headed demons.

A narrow fissure leads further into the earth. 

This would be a really good time to know a light spell. Pity none of you do.

Do you:

[[Explore where the fissure leads-&gt;High cave entrance]]

[[Descend to the lower path-&gt;Lower path]]

[[Spend the night here.-&gt;Cave night]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="476" name="Lower path" tags="" position="3076,5437" size="100,100">It&#39;s a fairly easy scramble which is lucky given the fading light. 

At last you reach the scrub and find a wide rocky basin into which a tiny trickle of water falls from higher up the cliff. 

The level of water in the basin is very low - clearly much diminished.  It&#39;s not great tasting but you have little choice but to sip a little to quench your thirst.

As you do so, you notice what looks like a low cave entrance on the cliff-side of the pool,. Normally you imagine it was hidden, beneath the pool water. A long period of dry has exposed the top of the entrance. 

Nevertheless you will have to wade throught the shin-deep water to reach it.

[[Wade across the pool to the cave entrance.-&gt;Low cave entrance]]

It looks like the tunnel might emerge above the water futher down... but you can&#39;t be certain and it will be pitch black when you get there.

You remember the rope on the horse you lost.

The water becomes colder as you swim into the darkness, coming up occasionally to test for air.

At last, just as you are about to turn back, you reach an air pocket and soon after the floor rises and you are able to clamber onto rocks. 

You peer into the pitch black. 

And see nothing.

You feel around for your axe but find nothing.

&quot;Looking for this?&quot; asks a female voice in your ear.

You whirl round and stare into a pair of green eyes of a deeply scarred and tattooed face.

Around you must be a dozen armed warriors. 

Most resemble the woman facing you: axe-wielding women warriors - tattoed heavily and with tokens of their victims hanging from wrists or belts. 

But among them are few male warriors. One clearly a young light-worshipping nomad with a golden arrow knocked in his bow. 

&quot;The Open Wound Clan welcomes you once again Cuthbert Coriales,&quot; hisses the axe wielding female warrior.

You have heard the voice before and seen her face many years back. 

Then you remember: Occala Wayblue a rune master of Babeester Gor who you met at the Garhound festival. 

She pushes you with worrying strength into the darkness, laughing as you stumble forward.

Two torches are lit somewhere ahead of you and you stumble after them.

On the floor beneath the alter you see multiple skulls and bones. Most are of herd beasts and other animals. 

Some however, are clearly human. One still bears the cloven remains of helmet.

# Chapter {chapter}: Protectors of the Abandoned Earth

Over the days and weeks that follow, you are shown hospitatlity and learn the ways of the clan.

You learn of the [[deep caverns]] where you family and kin sleep among the the women of this and many other clans.

You practice your skills against the [[Barbeester Gor women]].  

You meet the other [[Husband protectors]] who the whispering of the Abandoned Earth have brought to serve the clan.

You learn of the [[dangers that the clan has already faced this long winter.-&gt;Dangers faced]]

And wonder what [[further dangers await-&gt;Dangers await]]

About two dozen are women of the clan, the others refugees from many parts of Prax and Pavis.

They look more alive than many of your fellow warriors. But in a sleep from which they cannot be woken. 

Only the Barbeester Gor are allowed to dwell here - one of them always watching over the sleepers.

{back link}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="505" name="Barbeester Gor women" tags="" position="1568,5528" size="100,100">You learn that Occala Wayblue came to the Abandoned Earth a couple of seasons prior to the Windstop. 

&quot;I was tired of the ways of men. And the prophecies of the Earth priestesses spoke of a time of great travail. Truthfully, I prefer the company women in a time of suffering - they complain less and do more.&quot;

She is accompanied by ten other women warriors, two who came with her from Garhound the others members of the Abandoned Earth.

For all her words, she shows surprising care towards the male warriors who have sworn the oath to protect the Open Wound Clan.

&quot;Think of these coming times like the tests you faced at the Garhound Festival,&quot; she advises. &quot; Only deadlier and longer lasting.&quot;

Stantor leads the other warriors and if grateful that you came with a sacrifice for otherwise he would have had to fight you to the death.
[continue]

The warriors are from different cultures and cults.

Many are nomads - worshippers of Waha or Urox - but they include a young Yelmite grazelander from distant Dragon Pass who avoids your glance.

Two are Orlanthi from Garhound.

And then there is the dark troll Argan Argar worshipper.

A few like you have some bond to the women sleeping here. Many do not, or so they claim.

Some are friendly, some less so, but you are all bound together in  service to Karista Gor.

{back link}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="507" name="Dangers faced" tags="" position="1892,5524" size="100,100">**Earth Season:** The clan was attacked by the neighbouring Twisted Spire clan a few weeks after the Windstop. They had long been hostile and with Ernalda sleeping attacked the Open Wound Clan in force.

The hall was burnt down, crops pillaged and a rock fall was summoned to block the lower cavern entrances.  Many lives on both sides were lost.

Then the neighbouring clan withdrew, binding ghosts to watch over the Open Wound clan.


**Darkness season:** Trolls attacked. A new tunnel opened close to the deepest caves - the Barbeester Gor claim darkness was seeking to claim the Earth and carry the sleepers to the Underworld.

Many were slain, but many good warriors also died. More tunnels were collapsed onto the invaders, blocking off parts of the complex. One troll remained - an Argan Argar merchant saving his life by swearing to be a protector of those who sleep.


**Storm season:** Orlanthi raiders from Garhound raided and later bounty hunters came - a rag bag few who either died or betrayed their fellows as sacrifices. The survivors include the two Garhounders and the Grazelander who serve as protectors.

And then you came.

They talk of Sea season and Magasta - the sea god who was once a bride of the Earth. A few wonder if Zola Fel will seek to inundate their caverns.

And they wonder of the light worshippers in Sun County and whether they might raid this Fire Season, despite their bonds to the Earth.

## Sea Season 1622

No raiders come but a greater danger grows. The rivulet of water that filled the cliff pool and provided water to the clan ceases.

Water becomes scarce as the weeks pass. The pool dries out, exposing the entrance to the open sky.

A permanent guard is placed on the new entrance.

Two shallow pools within the caves remain, but you know they will last no longer than a few weeks. [[No water feeds them any more.-&gt;Sea water]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="510" name="Sea water" tags="" position="1354,5656" size="100,100">&quot;The water gods abandon the Earth, just like all her husbands abandoned her!&quot; mutter the women warriors.

Eventually the Occala summons you and a few others - including the troll and tasks you with exploring the deepest caverns in search of water.

You perform rituals and speak of myths of the springs of water that watered the earth in times of darkness.

You are happy to join the [[search-&gt;Search water]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="511" name="Search water" tags="" position="1192,5620" size="100,100">The troll leads the way in your search. 

You find yourself dependent on the Yelmite and his light spells. You know he both fears and hates your troll guide.

There are several times when you wonder whether you are being led into an ambush. Or perhaps on some secret path to the Underworld.

But eventually the troll returns and in broken trade talk says he has found a [[treasure.-&gt;Find treasure]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="512" name="Find treasure" tags="" position="1025,5604" size="100,100">You enter a long, dark cavern. As you cross the floor, pottery snaps and breaks under you feet. The shards of a multitude of amphoras and jar. The floor is littered with broken remains.

[[One jar remains intact-&gt;Bronze jar]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="513" name="Bronze jar" tags="" position="877,5596" size="100,100">release_mallia: false

It is a large amphora-shaped jar. Made from bronze and closed with a cork bung and wax seal, it looks like it has laid here for decades if not longer. Just visible on the seal are the runes of wind, mobility and mastery.

Once the jar was painted, but hardly anything remains. You think you see a faint image of Orlanth fighting a blue dragon, but cannot be sure.

The troll gently rocks it and you hear what sounds like a liquid sloshing inside.

Do you:

[[Open the jar.-&gt;Release daga]]

[[Leave it.-&gt;Leave jar]]

[[Carry the jar back to the surface.-&gt;Carry jar]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="514" name="Release daga" tags="" position="618,5564" size="100,100">release_daga: true

--
You pull the bung out and there is a dry laugh as sand and dry earth blows out of the jar. Your torches reveal a skeletal form above you, formed from the dust and earth.

Then with a soul-rattling scream it vanishes down the cave - in the direction you descended by.

You wonder whether to [[reseal the jar]] or [[see if anything else is in it?-&gt;Look into jar]]?

Or accept it&#39;s all too late and quickly [[retrace you steps to the surface-&gt;Return surface]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="515" name="Leave jar" tags="" position="935,5776" size="100,100">Something about this find seems wrong. You look distrustfully at the troll.

Your followers and the nomad, however, look confused and angry when you decide to leave the jar where it lies. 

&quot;Surely this is a gift from Orlanth?&quot; asks Karyth.

Do you: 

[[Agree to take it with you despite its weight-&gt;Carry jar]] 

[[Agree and open it here to check what&#39;s inside-&gt;Release daga]]

You wonder whether to open it there and then, but descide it safer  to carry heavy jar without opening it.

Or maybe something about the jar and the seal upon it makes you hesitate. 

Or is it that you do not trust the troll. How did he find it here? Who left it here and why?

Is this myth or the waking world?

You tell the troll to carry it, as you retrace your steps [[back to the surface.-&gt;Return surface]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="518" name="Return surface" tags="" position="477,5968" size="100,100">Slowly you retrace your steps...

[if jar===&quot;take&quot;]
The troll complains a lot about how slow you are even when he carries the bronze jar. At least you are not returning empty handed.

[if jar===&quot;leave&quot;]
You feel that your quest for water has failed and wonder how the Babesster Gor and your brother warriors will take news of having left the bronze jar behind. You wonder if you should not speak of what you found, but you doubt the troll or Yelmite will follow your wishes.

[if jar ===&quot;open&quot;]
You feel that your quest for water has failed and fear recounting what was released from the Bronze jar.

[continue]
Finally you return to the welcome light of the [[upper caves and the canyon of the Abandoned Earth.-&gt;Discuss jar]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="519" name="Discuss jar" tags="" position="509,6126" size="100,100">You recount your discovery of the bronze jar and the sound of liquid within.

And then you tell of your decision to open it. 

Occala shakes her head disparagingly.

&quot;You do not know your own myths Orlanthi - or do your memories sleep with your god?

It was Daga you released. Daga who your god defeated only by slaying the dragon Aroka and releasing the waters within it. Daga who your god sealed in a jar with the help of Heler the rain god and many others. Daga: the god of drought.&quot;

She shrugs. 

&quot;I wish you had walked a different myth. Prax is suffer and there will be no rain until the darkness ends. Perhaps then, those who survive can reseal the bronze jar with Daga within.

Go sleep, you have played your role for [[better or worse.&quot;-&gt;Jar sleep]]

[if jar===&quot;take&quot;]
You recount all that occured and reveal the bronze jar the troll has carried back to the surface.

Occala shakes her head. 

&quot;This relates to the deeds of your god not my goddess. Do you think it a gift or a curse?&quot;

Do you:

[[Say it is a gift-&gt;Jar gift]]

[[Say  it is a curse-&gt;Jar curse]]

[[Admit you don&#39;t know-&gt;Jar uncertain]]

[if jar===&quot;leave&quot;]
You admit your quest for water has failed and recount your discovery and decision to leave the bronze jar behind. Many of the Babeester Gor and other warriors angrily denounce the decision but Occala remains silent. 

&quot;Maybe you did well to leave it, for I doubt what gifts Orlanth can make when he sleeps.&quot;

Not all the warriors seem to share her opinion.

Then with a soul-rattling scream it vanishes out of the cave to the land beyond.

Occala shakes her head angrily.

&quot;You do not know your own myths Orlanthi - that was no gift, but Daga the god of drought you have released!&quot;

She sighs. 

&quot;I wish you had walked a different path. There will be no rain until the darkness ends. Perhaps then, those who survive can reseal the bronze jar with Daga within.

## Fire Season 1622

Fires season arrives and the water keeps dwindling.

[if stantor_dead===false]
Stantor does his best to keep morale up, but it is not easy.
[continue]
Arguments among the warriors are frequent and the lethargy of thirst affects everyone. Barbeester Gor warriors permanently watch over the dwindling pools of water within the caverns. You hear some warriors muttering it is better to abandon the caves - perhaps seal the sleepers within the earth and let Ernalda watch over them. But the Barbeestor will not listen, claiming your duty is here and no where else.

Often you accompany the searches for water but always to no avail.  

[if release_mallia === true]
You see the first signs of illness and disease among the warriors. Mallia spirits haunt the caves.

[if jar===&quot;take&quot;]
[[One night you are woken by the sound of clashing weapons and cries from deep within the temple complex.-&gt;Daga unleashed]]

You follow several others towards the sound of fighting.

Within the hall of the sleepers, you see Occala and two of her initiates standing over the young Grazelander. Beside him lies the unsealed bronze jar.

&quot;Curse you worthless husbands!&quot; Exclaims Occala.

She looks in your direction.

&quot;You do not know your own myths Orlanthi. It was Daga you brought back. Daga who your god defeated only by slaying the dragon Aroka and releasing the waters within it. Daga who your god sealed in a jar with the help of Heler the rain god and many others. Daga: the god of drought.&quot;

&quot;And now this young fool, possessed or weak, has released it upon the land.&quot;

The young Yelmite begs for mercy.

Do you:

[[Speak in his favour asking for clemency.-&gt;Support grazelander]]

[[Remain silent.-&gt;Condemn grazelander]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="529" name="Support grazelander" tags="" position="249,6770" size="100,100">events: [...events,&quot;You gain clemency for a Grazelander who releases Daga. &quot;]

You speak for the young Grazelander - citing his youth and his ignorance of Orlanthi myths.

Your words calm Occala, she know there are so few of you that every warrior is valuable.

&quot;Let us hope you earn your mercy.&quot;

The Grazelander swears he will not fail again.

One morning, the horns blow from the watchers over the canyon. News arrives that warriors approach. 

As you rush to help protect the cavern, you suspect many = would prefer a quick death in battle to what awaits when [[the water finally runs out.-&gt;Failed ambush]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="532" name="Failed ambush" tags="" position="569,6746" size="100,100">Ambushes are prepared as the warriors enter the lower cavern beyond the dry cliff pool. 

But word comes back that these invaders have evaded them or even ambushed the ambushers. Some returning warriors claim they have light magics that cannot be dispelled, while others claim they are able to see in the dark better than a troll.

You are summoned to the temple cavern and there [[await the invading warriors-&gt;Yelm calls]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="533" name="Yelm calls" tags="" position="737,6732" size="100,100">They arrive.

Sun Dome templars. Well armoured and well supplied from the look of them. The light of their shields and lanterns dispels the shadows of the cave - and reveal the squalor of your existence.

Three templars, in particular, attract your attention. 

One a women and used to giving commands. 

The other a tall silent templar, face hidden by a full helm. He is bathed in a gentle light and you wonder at how much magic must be cast. 

The third looks out of place. Although dressed in gold engraved helmet and breastplate, he looks out of breath and uncertain compared to his companions. But he too appears is bathed in light.

The woman takes off her helm and offers [[greetings to the Abandoned Earth.-&gt;Allalia speaks]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="534" name="Allalia speaks" tags="" position="902,6738" size="100,100">It is Allalia Eskalos, once spear woman for Vega Goldbreath, the Guardian of Sun County.

&quot;We come to reclaim a spouse stolen from her rightful husband.&quot; 

The heavily breathing man takes off his helmet.

You blink in suprise and almost awe. Despite his posture, his face appears regal and judgemental. A bearded man in his 40s or 50s yet of noble bearing. 

You feel as if should bow your knee to him.

&quot;[[I, Lord Kyros of Pavis, servant of the Celestial Emperor Yelm reclaim my wife from the dead god Orlanth who stole her!&quot;.-&gt;Yelm audience]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="535" name="Yelm audience" tags="" position="1052,6745" size="100,100">events: [...events,&quot;In Fire Season, Lord Kyros accompanied by templars demands his wife is returned &quot;]

&quot;Another husband who abandoned his wife yet thinks it is he who commands in this place. You will learn different.&quot;

Allalia does not move, but Kyros steps forward with a sneer.

&quot;Like Yelm it is not I who abandoned my bride. I took her as my wife and honoured her in every way. Rather it is she who was stolen from me by the outlaws of Orlanth - that is not abandonment, that is theft... And the thieves are hiding here among you!&quot;

He stares directly across at you.

Do you:

Then the other templar places a firm hand on his shoulder.

&quot;Yelm showed mercy to Orlanth - he judged but did not seek vengeance.&quot;

You see the anger of Kyros and for a brief moment you wonder if he will turn on the Sun Domer. Yet
he knows a heroquest path must be followed, not strayed from.

&quot;Very well - return to me my stolen wife and you can continue your miserable livese in these barren caves. &quot;

The Barbeestor Gor priestess looks angry and ready to refuse his demand when a voice echos through the cave.

&quot;He is right - he is my husband whom I freely chose.
